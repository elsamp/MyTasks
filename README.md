MyTasks
=======

Background
-----------
During college I maintained a meticulously accurate Google spreadsheet of all the assignments, and other tasks I had on my plate for each and every day in each week of a semester. It was necessary as I was also working 20+ hours a week and keeping track of all the due dates, meetings, deadlines and managing the time each required was a little involved.

When I finished school I decided to model myself a task manager that resembled my google spreadsheet but required considerably less maintenance and included a few extra features to make my life easier. It’s goal is not to be everyone’s favourite task manager and I can guarantee there are many others available for free that provide more features and have more usibility/focus testing behind them. Instead this application aims simply to be exactly what I wanted, because that’s the perk of being a software developer.
